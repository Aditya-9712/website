# QuarkMe

The repository where QuarkMe's website is being developed. It's temporary public.

##About

Intending to enhance our education system with a view of facilitating independent thinking amongst students, QuarkMe is designed for our youth to be able to redefine their definition of learning. Quality of learning being the direct consequence of the methodology of teaching, we work to strengthen the latter to create a unique learning experience for our students so as to give rise to intellectual aptitude. Tutors at QuarkMe, in the most honest sense of the phrase, thrive to eliminate the need for dependency amongst the youth. Our teachers not only solve your problems, they train you hard enough so that you can solve them yourself.
